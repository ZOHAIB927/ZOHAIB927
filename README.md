## Hi there I'm Zohaib Khan👋


Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Data Analyst based in Adelaide, Australia, with a passion for turning complex data into meaningful insights (and maybe making it a little more fun along the way). With a background in agile methodologies, big data technologies, and a variety of programming languages, I’m here to solve your toughest data challenges (and throw in a bit of humor while I’m at it).

🚀 About Me

With 2+ years of experience in data engineering and a Master's in Project Management from Birmingham City University, The UK, I’ve worked on everything from automotive AI to roadway data analytics. My day-to-day? Making data dance with the power of Power BI, Tableau, Python, SQL, and anything else that helps create user-centric solutions.

My passion for data doesn’t stop at work – I’m currently working towards my Data Analysis program at Seneca Polytechnic to level up my skills and keep pushing boundaries.

🎯 Skills
Data Visualization: Power BI, Tableau (I make dashboards so pretty, they might just make you cry)
Programming: Python, Java, HTML (Yes, I’m fluent in three languages... and they’re all code.)
Frontend: React, Redux, TypeScript, Next.js (I’m the wizard behind the screen)
Databases: SQL & NoSQL (Because one is never enough!)
Other: Code Debugging & Documentation (Making bugs disappear like magic)
OS: Linux, MAC, Windows (I can work anywhere, even on Mars... if they had WiFi)
👨‍💻 Experience

August 2021 – January 2024

I turned data into actionable insights through Power BI dashboards.
Helped solve road traffic problems (yes, I made the roads smarter).
Managed a team of 12 (because someone had to keep everyone on track).
Used Sumo Logic to hunt down data drops and raised Zendesk tickets like a pro.
Worked under tight deadlines and handled clients' issues without breaking a sweat.
Computer Engineer | Atul Auto | Rajkot, Gujarat, India
October 2019 – January 2021

Designed and implemented AI-driven solutions to make vehicles smarter.
Kept everything running smoothly by designing and maintaining databases (because data is the backbone of everything).
Collaborated with cross-functional teams to deploy embedded systems (I call this “engineering magic”).
