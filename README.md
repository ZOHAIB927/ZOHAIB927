## Hi there I'm Zohaib Khan👋


Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Data Analyst based in Adelaide, Australia, with a passion for turning complex data into meaningful insights (and maybe making it a little more fun along the way). With a background in agile methodologies, big data technologies, and a variety of programming languages, I’m here to solve your toughest data challenges (and throw in a bit of humor while I’m at it).

**🚀 About me**

With 2+ years of experience in Business Data Analysis and a Master's in Business Analytics from Victoria University, Australia, I’ve worked on everything from automotive AI to roadway data analytics. My day-to-day? Making data dance with the power of Power BI, Tableau, Python, SQL, and anything else that helps create user-centric solutions.

My passion for data doesn’t stop at work – I’m currently working as a Freelancer to solve my clients' business problems and keep pushing boundaries.

**🎯 Skills**

Data Visualization: Power BI, Tableau (I make dashboards so pretty, they might just make you cry)

Programming: Python Pandas, Java, HTML (Yes, I’m fluent in three languages... and they’re all code.)

Databases: SQL & NoSQL (Because one is never enough!)

Other: Code Debugging & Documentation (Making bugs disappear like magic)
